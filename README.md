# CSCI 3230U - Final Project - UOIT Course Scheduler
Members:
- Martin Tuzim
- Devon McGrath

## Description
One of the challenges students (especially first-years) face is creating a good schedule. It can be very time consuming to create a good schedule. This web application allows users to create schedules for a given semester and interactively select sections to include. The resulting schedule can be exported to an image (of the schedule) or a CSV file of section CRNs.

## TODO
- [ ] Front-end: create pages, style, front-end JS
- [ ] Node.js: Create back-end server
- [ ] Node.js: Create web scraper for getting course listings
- [ ] Other requirements...
